This is an example of a file created in class
In fact, the command was "touch #filename"
Let's briefly recall the several commands we made
ls -> list of what is in this folder
mkdir -> make directory (folder)
cd -> create directory
cp -> copy? creates an exact replica
mv -> moves from one folder to anote (and includes new file name)
